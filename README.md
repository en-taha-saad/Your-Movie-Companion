# Your Movie Companion ðŸŽ¬
# Cinema-Tickets-App

Welcome to the repository of "Your Movie Companion", my first project developed using Android Jetpack Compose. This modern, fully declarative UI toolkit is designed to simplify UI development, and it was a pleasure exploring it over the course of this project.

## About the App
Inspired by a design I found on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/18133523-Movie-Tickets-Mobile-App), this app is all about discovering and booking movie tickets in cinemas near you. Users can explore the latest films, browse through different genres, and book their seats, all from the comfort of their homes.

Please note that at this stage, the app is a design-only prototype. It simulates functionality but does not interact with real-world data. However, I'm considering evolving it into a fully functioning app in the future.

## Learning Journey
This prototype development marked my first week exploring Jetpack Compose. I've learned a lot through this process, and I'm excited to apply these learnings to future projects.
